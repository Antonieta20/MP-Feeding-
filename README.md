# MP-Feeding- Experiment
Heterotrophic feeding modulates the effects of microplastics on corals, but not when combined with heat stress
In this repository you'll find all raw data as well as the code we used to process these for our manuscript. 

We analyzed after the 6-weeks MP experiment: (I) the coral host growth (i.e., growth rates: surface area, volume growth, and calcification rates), (II) the photosynthesis of the coral symbionts (i.e., net photosynthesis, respiration, gross photosynthesis, effective quantum yield (Y(II)) and maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm)), and (III) the energy budget of the coral (i.e., total content of: carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, and total energy content). of the reef-building corals Pocillopora verrucosa and Stylophora pistillata. After the short term heat phase, we analyzed: the physiological response to MP and feeding are connected to bleaching susceptibility of the corals (i.e, tissue brightness). For the statistical assessment and data visualization we used the statistical R Project for Statistical Computing Software together with the graphical user interface RStudio. System info of R, RStudio, and a list of all used packages can be found in this repository. 

# General terminology
Sampling timepoints are referred to as: t0 - before the addition of microplastic and  t1 - 6 weeks after the start feeding regime and the addition of microplastic.

Used coral species are referred to as: Pve - Pocillopora verrucosa Spi - Stylophora pistillata

Used microplastic polymers: PE - black polyethylene fragments PVC - grey polyvinyl chloride fragments PS - beige polystyrene fragments PP - red polypropylene fibers PET - blue polyester fibers PA - yellow polyamide fibers
